Seed Rate & Spacing
	•	Seed Rate: 3–4 kg/acre (for hybrid)
	•	Spacing: 45 cm × 15 cm (row × plant)


Water & Climate Needs
	•	Grows well in low rainfall (250–500 mm annually)
	•	Does well in light soils (sandy loam to loam)
	•	Needs 1–2 irrigations only (if rain fails)
    Available in 1.5 Kg

Fodder crops - 

1.⁠ ⁠SSG (Sorghum Sudan Grass) 
	•	Fast-growing: First cut in 45–50 days
	•	Multi-cut: Up to 5–6 harvests in a season
	•	High yield: 350–500 quintals/acre (green fodder)
	•	High nutrition: Rich in protein (8–12%), digestible, juicy
	•	Good for silage, green feeding, or mixing with dry fodder

Sowing Season
	•	Kharif (Main Season): June – July (with onset of monsoon)
	•	Summer (Zaid): February – March (with irrigation)
    Available in 5 kg

Fodder crops 
2.⁠ ⁠Multicut Fodder Rajka Bajri 
	•	Multicut fodder hybrid variety of bajra (pearl millet)
	•	Tolerates drought and heat – ideal for Rajasthan
	•	Produces 3–5 cuts in one season
	•	Soft, juicy leaves and stems – highly palatable
	•	Rich in crude protein (9–11%) and digestibility

First Cut
45–50 days after sowing
Regrowth Interval
30–35 days between cuts
Suitable Regions
Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat, UP

Sowing Season
	•	Kharif (main season): June–July

Seed Rate & Spacing
	•	Seed Rate: 5–6 kg/acre
	•	Spacing: 30–40 cm row-to-row × 10–15 cm plant-to-plant
    Available in 1 KG

Fodder crop - 

Lucerne (Rajka grass) : 
Rajka seeds are used to grow rajka grass, also known as Alfalfa or Lucerne , which is one of the most nutritious and high-yielding fodder crops for livestock.
Use: Primarily fodder for cattle, goats, and other livestock
	•	Nutritional Value: High in protein (18–22%), calcium, and vitamins
	•	Root System: Deep-rooted – drought-tolerant once established

Key Features
	•	Can be cut 8–10 times per year under proper management
	•	Improves soil fertility by fixing nitrogen
	•	Suitable for loamy, well-drained soils
	•	Best grown in areas with mild winters and hot summers

⸻

Sowing Details
	•	Best Sowing Time:
	•	October to February in North India
	•	Post-monsoon in other regions

Seed Rate:
	•	8–10 kg/acre (broadcasting)
	•	Use treated seeds to avoid fungal diseases
	•	Spacing: 25–30 cm between rows
	•	Irrigation: First irrigation right after sowing, then weekly
    Available in 1 Kg

Fodder crop - 
Chicory (Kasni fodder) 
Kasni fodder seeds are from a special variety of Cichorium intybus (chicory) selected for forage use, not medicinal or culinary. When grown as fodder, Kasni provides a nutritious, high-protein green feed—especially useful for dairy cattle, goats, and sheep.
Key Benefits
	•	High protein: ~18–22% (comparable to Lucerne)
	•	Rich in minerals, especially calcium and magnesium
	•	Promotes better milk yield and animal digestion
	•	Natural anthelmintic (helps reduce internal parasites in livestock)
	•	Can be grazed or harvested for green fodder

Best Sowing Time
August–October or early spring
Seed Rate
3–5 kg/acre
Soil Requirement
Well-drained, light loamy or sandy soil
Irrigation
Moderate (drought-tolerant once grown)
Cuttings per Year
4–5 cuttings/year under good care

Fodder crop - 

Hybrid Chicory (hybrid Kasni fodder) - 
Hybrid chicory seeds refer to improved or selectively bred varieties of Cichorium intybus developed specifically for fodder (forage), leaf yield, and digestibility—not for medicinal or root harvest.

These hybrids are ideal for high-protein livestock feed, offering faster growth, better disease resistance, and often higher dry matter yield than traditional Kasni (desi chicory) varieties.
Primary Use
Livestock fodder (cut-and-carry or grazing)
Growth Habit
Rosette-forming, leafy with broad taproot
Protein Content
18–22% crude protein
Tolerances
Drought-tolerant, heat-tolerant (mild), and pest-resistant
Best Sowing Time
August–October or February–March
Seed Rate
3–5 kg/acre
Sowing Method
Broadcasting or line sowing (30 cm spacing)
Irrigation
Every 10–15 days in dry periods
Harvesting
First cut ~60–70 days after sowing, then every 30–45 days
